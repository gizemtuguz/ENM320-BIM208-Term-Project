# ENM320 Production and Operations Planning II & Bƒ∞M208 Computer Programming IV Term Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a software solution to determine the optimal lot size (ùëÑ) and reorder point (ùëÖ) for given data. The software requests various cost and demand parameters, calculates holding costs, and uses these inputs to determine key decision variables and performance measures. The calculations leverage the Z-Chart and Loss Function values to iteratively find the optimal solution.

## Features

- **Input Collection**: Requests costs (unit cost, ordering cost, penalty cost), interest rate, lead time, lead time demand, and lead time standard deviation from the user.
- **Annual Demand Calculation**: Computes annual demand based on lead time and demand.
- **Z-Chart and Loss Function Integration**: Automatically looks up normal distribution and loss function values during the iteration process.
- **Output Decision Variables and Performance Measures**:
  - Optimal lot size (ùëÑ)
  - Reorder point (ùëÖ)
  - Number of iterations
  - Safety stock
  - Average annual holding, setup, and penalty costs
  - Average time between order placements
  - Proportion of order cycles with no stockout
  - Proportion of unmet demands

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode) or a text editor
- Command-line interface (CLI) for running Java programs

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/gizemtuguz/ENM320-BIM208-Term-Project.git
 cd ENM320-BIM208-Term-Project
 ```
   
2. **Compile the Java Program**:

 ```bash
javac src/Calculation.java
 ```

3. **Run the Java Program**:

 ```bash
java -cp src Calculation
 ```

## Input Values:
The program will prompt you to enter the following values:

- Unit cost (c)
- Interest rate (i)
- Penalty cost (p)
- Ordering cost (K)
- Lead time (T)
- Mean demand (mean)
- Standard deviation of demand (dev)

## View Results:
The program will output the optimal order quantity, reorder point, safety stock, and other performance measures.

## Example
### Input
 ```bash
Enter unit cost (c): 20
Enter interest rate (i): 0.25
Enter penalty cost (p): 20
Enter ordering cost (K): 100
Enter lead time (T): 4
Enter mean demand (mean): 500
Enter standard deviation of demand (dev): 100
 ```
### Output
 ```bash
Initial F Value: 0.8847
Optimal Order Quantity: 173.21
Reorder Point: 600.0
Safety Stock: 100.0
 ```
## File Structure
- **src/Calculation.java:** The main Java file containing the logic for the calculations.
- **src/excel.csv:** The CSV file with Z-Chart and Loss Function values used in the iterative process.
